## Problem 1

This problem focuses on NYC Transit Data. Below we import and clean data from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. The process begins with data import, updates variable names, and selects the columns that will be used in later parts fo this problem. We update entry from yes / no to a logical variable. As part of data import, we specify that Route columns 8-11 should be character for consistency with 1-7.
